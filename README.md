# Bob-Ross-Art-Generation
Generating images from GAN (Generative Adversial Model) trained on dataset of 2600 Bob Ross paintings.

Using a CNN GAN architecture for image generation.

Project was used as a platform to experiment with various techniques to increase effectiveness of training process.
Techniques include:
* label smoothing
* Two Time-Scale Update Rule
* Continual monitoring and early stopping

Overall the training stability was much improved compared to when the model was left to train without implementing these measures.
